# OncoDrug
Resource of Mutation Dependent Combination Cancer Therapy
## Purpose
Combinations of cancer drugs have the potential to overcome resistance, improve the response rate of existing drugs, and reduce dose-limiting toxicity associated with single agents. Existing drug combination databases only provide response data, such as synergy scores between two drugs, without important contextual information to assist oncologists in matching their patients with these combinations in an evidence-based way. To address this gap, OncoDrug+ provided detailed genetic evidences, pharmacological target information and evidence scores supporting each combination strategy, making evidence-based experimental or clinical applications of cancer drug combinations be possible. Thus we anticipate that it will be a useful tool for catalyzing precision combinatorial therapy.
